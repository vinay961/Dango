# Here we have to study about basic python and how it work

# Python is dynamically typed language, we don't need to declare variable type it get automatically assign inside memory. a=10  
# a = 10
# print(a)
# a="Vinay"
# print(a) 
# In this example we can see that a work as number datatype for some instance and for other instance it act as string type, that why we say that datatype is not assigned to a but it assigned to 10 and that word inside memory.

# if you want to specify the data type of variable then we can use casting.
# x = str(3)
# y = int(3)
# z = float(3)
# print(type(x))

# Variables are case-sensitive
# a = 10
# A = "Vinay"
# print(A)
# print(a)

# Some important type of question 
# print(5+3)
# print('ram'+'shyam')
# print(2,3)
# print(2+"Vinay")  #It gives us error bcz we cann't concatenate the diffirent data types with each other.

# Note--> That we can use the global keyword to declare any variable global.

# Datatypes --> Mutable == list,dictionary,set,bytesArray && Immutable == Integer,float,complex,string,tupes,frozen set,bytes
# Now to understand the concept of immutable and mutable we have to understand the inner working python
# a = 10
# b = a
# print(a,b) # output-> 10,10
# b = 20
# print(a,b) # output-> 10,20
