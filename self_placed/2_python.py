# how to use else if in python

# a = 10
# b = 20
# if a==b :
#     print("Both numbers are equal.")
    
# elif a>b:
#     print("First number is greater then Second one.")
    
# else:
#     print("Second number is greater then first.")


# Loop in python

# i = 1
# while i <= 5 :
#     print( i+1 )
#     if i == 3:
#         break
#     i+=1

# fruits = ["apple","Mango","Orange","pineApple",]
# for x in fruits:
#     print(x)

# for x in "Vinay":
#     print(x)

# for x in range(5):  # start from zero and continue till n-1
#     print(x)  
# else:
#     print("Loop completed")

# Past Statement in python -> if we don't want to write anything in for loop then we can use pass

# for x in "Vinay":
#     pass           when we use pass statement it doesn't return any error.
