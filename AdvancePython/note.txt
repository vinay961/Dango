mutable --> here we can change the data types.

>>> username = "Vinay"
>>> username
'Vinay'
>>> username = "Rai"
>>> username
'Rai'

immutable --> we cann't change the value of data type . example - string
but in above code we can say that value of username get change, but it doesn't actually.

username --> "Vinay"

but when we gave the username Rai then 
username   "Vinay"(It will get collected as garbage value and then deleted)
   '-------> "Rai"

   Note--> we need to note that username Vinay is not get change.
