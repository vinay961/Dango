Data Types in Python

Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to declare variables with their types explicitly
Python automatically assigns data types to variables based on the value they hold

Numeric Types
int: Represents integer values, e.g., 5, -3, 0
float: Represents floating-point numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.001, 2.0

Sequence Types
str: Represents strings, e.g., "hello", 'world', "123"
list: Ordered collection of items, mutable (changeable), e.g., [1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
tuple: Ordered collection of items, immutable (unchangeable), e.g., (1, 2, 3), ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')

Mapping Type
dict: Unordered collection of key-value pairs, mutable, e.g., {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}

Set Types
set: Unordered collection of unique items, mutable, e.g., {1, 2, 3}, {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
frozenset: Immutable version of set, e.g., frozenset({1, 2, 3})

Boolean Type
bool: Represents boolean values, either True or False

None Type
None: Represents the absence of a value or a null value

Additional concepts

Mutable vs. Immutable: Mutable types can be modified after creation, while immutable types cannot
Ordered vs. Unordered: Some types maintain the order of elements, while others do not
Unique Values: Sets and dictionaries require their elements or keys to be unique, meaning duplicate elements or keys are automatically removed
Dynamic Typing: In Python, you can reassign variables to different data types
Understanding these data types and their properties is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free Python code
